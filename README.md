## Correlation-between-largest-Banks-Nifty-Indices
Correlation between largest Banks &amp; Nifty Indices by analyzing one minute candlestick using Pytho.

I have tried to analyze the returns given by Major Nifty Indices and Major Banks in India using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
I have used one-minute timeframe for
analysis.
 
What I found is The higher the Weightage
higher the correlation with the index. Data is from January 2017 to January
2021
 
Findings:
Bank Nifty and Nifty Financial Services Index is Highly Correlated 0.95
Strangely Nifty Financial Services and Nifty 50 have more correlation than Bank Nifty and Nifty 50.
HDFC and Bank Nifty Correlation is 0.73
In contrast to Nifty Indices, HDFC Bank has a low correlation with other major banks.
Among the Datasets we examine, ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank have the poorest correlation.
